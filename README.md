# Simple Table Service App 

Create a well-designed application that allows “Sult Bar & Restaurant” staff to take table orders from bar customers. 

When the form loads (or has been cleared for next user), the server enters their name and the table number that they are serving. On pressing the Start button, the server is brought to an order screen, where they can enter the number of each type of pizzas that the customers want to order. 

When the Order button is pressed, the application displays the total number of Pizza’s and receipts for that order along with the server’s name. Note a surcharge of €2.49 is to be applied to the total of each table order as a service charge. 

If the user presses the Summary button, the application displays the total number of transactions, total pizzas sold, total company receipts and the average transaction value (if at least one transaction has taken place prior to being pressed). If the Clear button is pressed at any time, the form is reset for the next user. On pressing the Exit button, the form closes. 

Ensure that you handle any exceptions that could occur in your project and ensure that the user is helped recover from any error of this type. Remember to use good naming conventions for controls & variable names; include remarks at the top of each event handler and at the top of the class. Include ToolTips & Access Keys as appropriate.
